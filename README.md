local-crontab is a Python wheel and command line utility to convert a crontab, in a local timezone, into a set of UTC crontabs. 
It creates multiple UTC crontabs because of Daylight Saving Time.<br>
This project would be a transposition in Python of JS [local-crontab](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/local-crontab) by [UnitedIncome](https://github.com/UnitedIncome).
